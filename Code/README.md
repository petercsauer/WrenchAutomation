# Code

The code for this project was done in C in the [MPLAB X IDE](https://www.microchip.com/mplab/mplab-x-ide). This code is written for and loaded onto a [PIC32MX250F128B](../Docs/PIC32MX1XX2XX-28-36-44-PIN-DS60001168K.pdf) microcontoller.

The purpose of this code is to control how the electromagnet and stepper motor get triggered and rotated respectively. The code controls GPIO pins on the microcontroller to be set high and low so as to rotate the stepper motor the necessary amount at the correct time and turn the electromagnet on and off at the correct times. 

A user button is used to step through each state, being electromagnet off, electromagnet on and rotate stepper motor. This allows for easy control of the system. This code can be easily changed to not rely on the button, in order to run the process without human intervention
