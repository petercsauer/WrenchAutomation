The initial goal of this project is to observe the manufacturing process of the Loggerhead Tools Bionic Wrench and identify a bottleneck in the process that can be addressed by automation.

With that goal set out, there no set requirements on what should be automated and how it should be automated. This allows for freedom and trust in following the design process to achieve the optimal solution to this problem.

After journey mapping the manufacturing process, giving time values for each task as well as automatibility ratings and assessments regarding what would be gained from autoation, it was clear to see that the set of tasks involved in placing the wrench jaws in the wrench are both the most automatable and automating them will result in the most gain to the entire process. 

As such the task is set out to use/design whatever is deemed appropriate to automate this process in a way that is both accurate and fast. 

A short term goal for this quarter could be a set of designs/prototypes for accomplishing the various steps involved in the 'wrench placement' process. More details in Milestones.md
