# Spring Quarter Milestones:

* Decision about bowl decramblers/feeders - Assess different feeders for feed rate, ability to handle small pieces, how pieces can be presented after descrambling, size, cost.
	-- maybe order them before end of the quarter (ask Prof. Brown). Quarter ends June 8


* 3D print and laser cut prototype parts - Thursday 23 May

* Experiment on different "arm" choices - such as magnetic, suction, normal gripper.  - Tuesday/Thursday 28/30 May

* Before June 8, have a prototype/design idea for placement of jaws in wrench - rotate wrench or rotate arm.

# Fall Quarter Milestones:

* Go into Fall quarter with plan to build design from Spring Quarter.

* Intitial Steps to fabricate the design - metal wor in the shop - 1st/2nd week

* Construct and put together mechatronic functionality of design - 3rd/4th week

* Integrate design parts to have functioning system

* Optimise design to its peak ability

* End Goal - fully automated system for placing jaws. Available to implement in manufacturing line
